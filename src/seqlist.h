 * SequenceList is the abstract base class for the classes that hold ordered
 * sequence of items in memory. To store/retreive items sequencially in memory,
 * in our multi-threaded, monotonically increasing seq model, we need these
 * classes around basic data structures like Linkedlist or Skiplist.
 *
 * 'OrderedStoredValue' is the in-memory representation of an item that can be
 * stored sequentially and SequenceList derivatives store a sequence of
 * 'OrderedStoredValues'. Based on the implementation of SequenceList,
 * OrderedStoredValue might have to carry an intrusive component that
 * is necessary for the list.
 *
 * SequenceList expects the module that contains it, takes the responsibility
 * of serializing the OrderedStoredValue. SequenceList only guarentees to hold
 * the OrderedStoredValue in the order they are sent to it. For this it forces
 * the write calls to pass the seq lock held by them
 *
 * Note: These classes only handle the position of the 'OrderedStoredValue' in
 *       the ordered sequence desired. They do not update a OrderedStoredValue.
 *
 *       In the file 'item', 'OrderedStoredValue' are used interchangeably
 *
 * [EPHE TODO]: create a documentation (with diagrams) explaining write, update,
 *              rangeRead and Clean Up
